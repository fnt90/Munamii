## Files & Directories

This project includes a 'public' folder for use with Firebase, containing the HTML files.

Within the 'public' folder are 'css' directory containing CSS files, 'fonts' directory containing two web font folders and 'images' directory containing website images.

The 'images' directory contains two subdirectories, 'cupcake' and 'weddingcake' which contain the cropped and resized product images. These directories each contain an 'originals' subdirectory containing the original unedited photos.
